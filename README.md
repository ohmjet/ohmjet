- 👋 Hi, We are @ohmjet . This account is a public account of our product development team.
- 👀 We're interested in Electric Vegicle (Cars, Scooters, Airplanes ), Renewable energy,  Sustainable World, Open Source.
- 🌱 We're currently learning everything that related OCPP , ISO 15118-20:2022, other compliences, certifications and frameworks related to Electric Vehicle market grow and improvements.
- 💞️ We're looking to collaborate on Electic Vehicle Charging Stations infrastracture and community. OhmJet focused on Residential charging stations and open to collobarations with hardware manufacturers.
- 📫 If you have any questions or you woudl like to help us develop and raise our project please reach me out via enaul ohmjetdotcom@gmail.com

What is OhmJet and Why our founder used this two amazing words: Ohm and Jet

Infromation from public sources : 

**Ohm**, abbreviation **Ω**, unit of electrical resistance in the metre-kilogram-second system, named in honour of the 19th-century German physicist Georg Simon Ohm. It is equal to the resistance of a circuit in which a potential difference of one volt produces a current of one ampere (1Ω = 1 V/A); or, the resistance in which one watt of power is dissipated when one ampere flows through it. Ohm’s law (q.v.) states that resistance equals the ratio of the potential difference to current, and the ohm, volt, and ampere are the respective fundamental units used universally for expressing quantities.

**Jet** is aircraft (or simply jet) is an aircraft (nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft) propelled by one or more jet engines.
Jet is a strong narrow stream of gas, liquid or flame that comes very quickly out of a small opening. The opening is also called a jet.
In our case and for us Jet is electricy stream something innovative that could rapidly change the world.
